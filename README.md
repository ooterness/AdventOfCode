# AdventOfCode

This is repository holds my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

# 2019

I solved the 2019 puzzles using C++.

Each .cpp file is a standalone program containing that day's solution.

Environment: Windows 10 / Dev-C++ version 5.11

# 2020

I have been using the 2020 puzzles as a training exercise to help me [learn Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/index.html).

To avoid creating a new crate for each day, all solutions are compiled as a single program.  To solve Day 19, run "cargo run 19".

Environment: Windows 10 / Cargo 1.49.0

# 2021

Rust again this year.

To avoid creating a new crate for each day, all solutions are compiled as a single program.  To solve Day 19, run "cargo run 19".

Environment: Windows 10 / Cargo 1.56.0

# 2022

Python this year.

Environment: Windows 10 / Anaconda 4.8.2
