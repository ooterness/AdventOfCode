# AdventOfCode

This is repository holds my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

It is also the home of the [aocfetch](./aocfetch) crate.

# 2015

This year was solved using Rust, over the course of 2023.

The Rust crate contains one binary per solution. To solve Day 19, run "cargo run --bin day19".

Environment: Windows 10 / Cargo 1.66.1

# 2016

This year was solved using Rust, over the course of 2023.

The Rust crate contains one binary per solution. To solve Day 19, run "cargo run --bin day19".

Environment: Windows 10 / Cargo 1.66.1

# 2017

This year was solved using Rust, over the course of 2023.

The Rust crate contains one binary per solution. To solve Day 19, run "cargo run --bin day19".

Environment: Windows 10 / Cargo 1.66.1

# 2018

This year was solved using Python, in 2022 December through 2023 January.

Environment: Windows 10 / Anaconda 4.8.2

# 2019

This is the first year I participated in real-time.  Everything before this year was done after-the-fact.

I solved the 2019 puzzles using C++.  This was challenging to debug, especially IntCode, but I made it work.

Each .cpp file is a standalone program containing that day's solution.

Environment: Windows 10 / Dev-C++ version 5.11

# 2020

I have been using the 2020 puzzles as a training exercise to help me [learn Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/index.html).

To avoid creating a new crate for each day, all solutions are compiled as a single program.  To solve Day 19, run "cargo run 19".

Environment: Windows 10 / Cargo 1.49.0

# 2021

Rust again this year.

To avoid creating a new crate for each day, all solutions are compiled as a single program.  To solve Day 19, run "cargo run 19".

Environment: Windows 10 / Cargo 1.56.0

# 2022

Python this year.  This is the first year that I completed all solutions by December 25.

Some solutions use the [AOCD package](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/) to fetch input data automatically.

Environment: Windows 10 / Anaconda 4.8.2

# 2023

Back to Rust.

The Rust crate contains one binary per solution. To solve Day 19, run "cargo run --bin day19".

Environment: Windows 10 / Cargo 1.66.1
